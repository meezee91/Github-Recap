## Common Git terms

1. ### Repository (Repo): A repository is a storage location where your project's files and revision history are stored. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a server).

2. ### Commit: A commit is a snapshot of changes made to files in the repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier (hash) and includes a message describing the changes.

3. ### Branch: A branch is a parallel version of the repository, allowing you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Branches are often used for feature development, bug fixes, or experimentation.
